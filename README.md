# JavaScript Control Flow

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

"Control flow" refers to the way our computers move through a program's code.   Understanding control flow allows us to trace the flow of a program based on its code. This skill is essential for programming in every language and paradigm.  In particular, **conditionals** and **loops** are fundamental to understanding modern programming languages.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Predict the output of boolean expressions, including "truthy" and "falsey" values.
- Write conditional statements based on descriptions of behavior.
- Compare & contrast `for` and `while` loops.
- Write loops based on descriptions of behavior.
- Identify "blocks" in JavaScript code.

### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Create and change variables of many types in the Chrome developer tools.
- Access and change values within objects and arrays.

<!--

### Binary Encoding

At the very lowest level, sequences of 1s and 0s called "binary code" drive everything a computer does, from outputting text in the terminal, to displaying complex video game graphics, to communicating with other computers across the internet.

It may seem like you can't express much with just 0s and 1s, but the trick is to use a lot of 0s and 1s.

##### Check for Understanding

Pair up. You'll be asking a series of questions for a survey, but legally you're only allowed to ask yes/no questions are allowed (to simulate 1s and 0s).  Work with your partner to try to design the shortest possible survey to get the following information from participants.

1. Is your phone on or off?

2. Is your favorite season spring, summer, fall, or winter?

3. What is your favorite month?

If you found 1, 2, and then 4 questions for the information above, your survey was very efficient!
 -->


### Boolean Logic

In boolean logic, every value is either `true` or `false`.

```js
typeof(true)    // boolean
typeof(false)   // boolean
```

JavaScript also treats every value as "truthy" or "falsey".  

To work within this system, we have to memorize which values are "falsey." It can take practice to quickly predict results, but developers can use this truthy/falsey system to write shorter code for conditional expressions.

To check whether some value is truthy or falsey, try the following structure in your JavaScript console:

```js
let myValue = "fishing";
if(myValue){
  console.log(myValue, " is truthy!");
} else {
  console.log(myValue, " is falsey!");
}
```

#### Basic Boolean Operators

An "operator" is represents a simple operation that can be done on an input to give some output, like `+` and `-` from math!

These operators give boolean outputs, but in JavaScript their inputs could be anything.

| English | "and" | "or" | "not" | "not not" |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------| :------- |
| Javascript | `&&` | &#124;&#124; | `!` | `!!` | |  
| e.g. | `a && b` | a  &#124;&#124; b | `!b` | `!!b` |
| spoken | A and B | A or B | not B | not NOT B |

> The `!` operator is sometimes pronounced 'bang!'.


#### Boolean Comparison Operators

These operators give boolean outputs, but in JavaScript their inputs could be anything.  

| strict equality | loose equality | not strictly equal | not loosely equal | greater than | less than | greater than or equal to | less than or equal to |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| `===` | `==` | `!==` | `!=` | `>` | `<` | `>=` | `<=` |
| spoken | A and B | A or B | not B | not NOT B |

> Strict equality checks type and value, while loose equality only compares value.

## Check for Understanding

1. What is the outcome of the following expressions?

  * `true || false`
  * `false && false`
  * `true && false`
  * `(false || true) && true`
  * `false && ((true || false) && (false || true))`

  <details><summary>answers</summary>
  ```js
  true || false    	   // true
  false && false	     // false
  true && false	       // false
  (false || true) && true	// true
  false && ((true || false) && (false || true))	// false
  ```
  Note that JavaScript is lazy when it can quit evaluating a boolean expression early. For example, in the last expression above, you can tell from just the first `false &&` that the whole expression will be false.
  </details>

1. Which of the following are falsey?
  * `"abc"`
  * `""`
  * `1`
  * `-0`
  * `Math.PI`
  * `NaN`
  * `Array`
  * `[]`
  * `Object`
  * `{}`
  * `null`
  * `undefined`

  <details><summary>answers</summary>
  truthy: `-0`, `""`, `NaN`, `null`, `undefined`      
  </details>

1. What is the outcome of the following expressions?
  * `1 && 6`
  * `0 || "hi"`
  * `["a","b","c"] || "123"`
  * `false || null`

  <details><summary>answers</summary>
  ```js
  1 && 6                     // 6
  0 || "hi"                  // "hi"
  ["a","b","c"] || "123"     // ["a","b","c"]
  false || null              // null
  ```

### Conditionals

![commuter flow chart](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f545891799690188cd2d25b1d06687af66627ab1/687474703a2f2f63646e2e746865626f6c646974616c69632e636f6d2f7061706572636c69702f68746d6c5f696d616765732f33353130382f696d616765732f6f726967696e616c2f77696c6c2d796f752d62652d6c6174655f66696e616c2e706e67)

#### `if/else`

The boolean expression inside an `if`'s parentheses will always be evaluated as truthy or falsey to determine what will happen next.

A diehard Giants fan might have the following rules for baseball games:

```js
if (giantsPlaying) {
  // get tickets to the game
}

if (!giantsPlaying) {
  // don't watch the game
}
```

We can rephrase this more succinctly using `if` and `else`.

```js
if (giantsPlaying) {
  // get tickets to the game
} else {
  // don't watch the game
}
```


Getting tickets to all Giants games would be expensive!  Maybe the Giants fan only wants to watch games that are in San Francisco.

```js
if (giantsPlaying && gameInSF){
  // get tickets to the game
} else {
  // don't watch the game
}
```

#### `else if`

If the Giant fan wants to watch games outside San Francisco, watching on TV might be an easier option.

```js
if (giantsPlaying && gameInSF){
  // get tickets to the game
} else if (giantsPlaying){
  // watch on tv
} else {
  // don't watch the game
}
```

#### Nested `if`s

Here's a strategy someone might use for choosing what to drink. Assume there's already a `person` variable saved.

```js
let drink;

if (person.sleepy) {
  if (before5pm) {
    drink = "coffee";
  } else {
    drink = "black tea";
  }
} else {
  if (person.isHungry){
    drink = "smoothie";
  } else {  
    drink = "water";
  }
}
```


#### `switch`

A `switch` statement checks the value of *one* variable or expression to determine which of many "cases" to jump to.  Here's code for a vending machine with a different price for each row:

```js
switch (row){
	case 1: 	
		price = 0.25;
		break;
	case 2:
		price = 0.50;
		break;
	case 3:
		price = 0.75;
		break;
	case 4:
		price = 1.00;
		break;
	default:  // the rest of the products (rows 5-7)
		price = 1.25;
}			
```

Any `switch` statement can be written as a series of `if`, `else if`, and/or `else`.  For WDI, we suggest avoiding `switch`.


### Conditional Control Flow Tricks

**Loose Control Flow** (watch out for edge cases!)

```js
let username = `${firstInitial}${lastName}`;
if ( username ) {
	// submit signup form
}

// code above does the same as:
if ( username.length > 0) {
	// submit signup form
}
```

**Ternary operator**

```js
var username = lastName ? `${firstName}${lastName}` : firstName;

// same as
var username;
if ( lastName ) {
	username = `${firstName}${lastName}`;
} else {
  username = firstName;
}
```

**Conditional assignment: `||` to set to a default value**

```js
var bestCity = yourCity || "San Francisco";

// same as

var bestCity = "San Francisco";
if ( yourCity ) {
	bestCity = yourCity;
}
```

<!-- **Conditional Execution: `&&` to set default behavior**

```js
badThing && alert("Uh oh!")

// same as

if ( badThing ) {
	alert("Uh oh!");
}

``` -->


#### ES6 Block Scope

<img width=200 alt="ES6 JavaScript" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3254910/23785405/6ffbd794-051c-11e7-9731-d1f0e7479a5a.png">

Remember, variables created with JavaScript's `let` and `const` reserved words have "block scope," meaning they only exist INSIDE the "block" where they were created.  

So what is a block?

A block is the portion of an `if`, `else`, `for`, `switch`, or similar statement that is between `{` and `}`. Functions also have their own blocks.  


#### Check for Understanding

1. In the example below, which line(s) are inside the `if` statement's block?

	```js
	1
	2 if ( degrees === 90 ) {
	3
	4     console.log('right angle');
	5 }
	6
	```


1. In the ES6 example below, on what line(s) is the `angle` variable in scope?

	```js
	1
	2 if ( degrees === 90 ) {
	3     let angle = 'right';
	4     console.log(`${angle} angle`);
	5 }
	6
	```



1. In the ES6 or ES5 example below, on what lines is the `angle` variable in scope?

	```js
	1
	2 if ( degrees === 90 ) {
	3     var angle = 'right';
	4     console.log(angle + ' angle');
	5 }
	6
	```

#### Check for Understanding: Practice Conditionals!

Whiteboard with a partner:

Jimmy loves roller coasters, but there are a bunch of rules (ugh!) for riding:

For starters, it costs 5 tokens. Here's how we might code that:

```js
// assume we'll have a tokens variable
// storing the number of tokens
if ( tokens >= 5 ) {
    console.log("Step right up!");
} else {
    console.log("Sorry, you can't ride")
}
```

Pseudocode or edit the code above to check the following requirements.  You can assume there are variables stored for `tokens`, `height`, `age`, `hasAdult`, `bossLooking`, and `hasPass`.

1. Add a requirement that riders must be at least 4ft tall.   

  <details><summary>answer</summary>
    ```js
    if (tokens >= 5 && height >= 4) {
        console.log("Step right up!");
    } else {
        console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
    }
    ```
  </details>

2. Add a requirement that riders must be at least 12 years old.  

  <details><summary>answer</summary>
    ```js
  	if (tokens >= 5 && height >= 4 && age >=12) {
  	    console.log("Step right up!");
  	} else {
  	    console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
  	}
    ```
  </details>

3. Replace the previous rule with this new rule: now riders under 12 can participate if they have an adult with them.  

  <details><summary>answer</summary>
    ```js
    if (tokens >= 5 && height >= 4 ) {
      if (age >= 12 || hasAdult){
          console.log("Step right up!");
      } else {
        console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
      }
    } else {
        console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
    }
    ```
  </details>

4. (If the boss isn't looking, you can go on in!)  

  <details><summary>answer</summary>
    ```js
    if (!bossLooking){
  		console.log("Step right up!");
  	} else {
  		if ( tokens >= 5 && height >= 4 ) {
  			if (age >= 12 || hasAdult){
  			    console.log("Step right up!");
  			} else {
  				console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
  			}
  		} else {
  		    console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
  		}
  	}
    ```
  </details>

5. Riders with a park pass get in free.

  <details><summary>answer</summary>
    ```js
    if (!bossLooking){
  		console.log("Step right up!");
  	} else {
  		if ( (tokens >= 5 || hasPass) && height >= 4 ) {
  			if (age >= 12 || hasAdult){
  			    console.log("Step right up!");
  			} else {
  				console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
  			}
  		} else {
  		    console.log("Sorry, you can't ride.");
  		}
  	}
    ```
  </details>



### Loops

Whenever we want to repeat something in code, we use a loop.  We can think of every loop as three parts: **initialization** (setup), **continue condition**, and **update expression**.


#### `while` loops


![endless pizza cartoon](http://38.media.tumblr.com/7d49b42da305f9d6302110c50ac6894e/tumblr_mmz3qo9q1N1rdutw3o1_400.gif)  
_While pizza is available, take pizza!_

In while loops, the initial setup happens before the loop. The continue condition goes inside the `while` parentheses. The updates happen inside the loop.


```js
var batteryPercent = 100;                // setup: initial state of battery
while (batteryPercent > 10) {            // continue condition: enough battery
  useDevice();
  batteryPercent = batteryPercent - 5;   // update: reduce time left
}
```

#### `for` loops

For loops allow the setup, continue condition, and update expression to live inside the `for` loop parentheses.

```js
for (var count = 1; count <= 3; count++){
  console.log(count);
}
console.log("Go Team!");
```

For loops only really need a continue condition (or the loop will never end!). We can do setup before the loop, and we can do updating inside the loop. In this way, a for loop can look a lot like a while loop.

```js
var minutesBeforeWork = 540;
for( ; minutesBeforeWork > 30; ) {
  minutesBeforeWork = minutesBeforeWork - 5;
}
```


For loops for arrays usually use a counter variable to move through the indices of the array.

```js
var friends = ["Bali", "Nat", "Kelly"]
for (var i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
  console.log(friends[i] + " is a nice person");
}
```

In ES6, `for ... of` loops are used to loop through arrays.
```js
var friends = ["Bali", "Nat", "Kelly"]
for (let friend in friends) {
  console.log(`${friend} is a nice person`);
}
```

We'll see how to use special iterator methods to move through arrays sequentially. Iterator methods are wonderful for that.  For loops in JavaScript are much more flexible than iterator methods, though, so it's important to get a handle on them.




<!--
Here's an example that takes advantage of JavaScript for loops' flexibility (perhaps at the cost of readability!).  

```js
for (var height=48, yearlyGrowth=1, age=8; age<=18; height += yearlyGrowth){
   if (growthSpurt){
      yearlyGrowth = 6;
   } else {
      yearlyGrowth = 1;
   }
   age++;
}
console.log("Adult height is ", height, " inches!");
```

 -->

#### `break`

The reserved word `break` will break us out of a loop immediately.  

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i+=2) {
  console.log(i);
  break;
}

var j=0;
while (j < 10) {
  console.log(j);
  break;
  j += 2;
}
```

#### Check for Understanding: Practice Loops!

Use a `for` or `while` loop to console log a shuttle launch countdown:  "T minus 10", then "9", "8", "7", "6", "5", "4", "3", "2", "1", "0", "Liftoff!".

<details><summary>answer</summary>
  ```js
  console.log("T minus 10");
  for (var i=9; i>=0; i--){
    console.log(i);   // can log i.toString() to convert
  }
  console.log("Liftoff!");
  ```

  ```js
  console.log("T minus 10");
  i = 9;
  while (i>=0){
    console.log(i);   // can log i.toString() to convert
    i--;
  }
  console.log("Liftoff!");
  ```
</details>


### Independent Practice

Practice with this [training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/js-control-flow-training/).  


### Closing Thoughts

The most important things to practice right now are:

- predicting the output of boolean expressions.
- working with more complex, nested conditionals and/or loops.
- remembering the three-part structure of loops and the syntax for each kind of loop.
